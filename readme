In it, numbers 3, 6 and 9 do not exist and, according to Rodin, this is because these numbers represent a vector of
the third to fourth dimension, called the "flow field". This field is a higher dimensional energy, with influence on
the energy circuit of the other six numbers. Going even further, Randy Powell, a student of Marko Rodin, says that this
is the secret key to free energy, which Tesla has researched until the last days of life.
